{"img_path": "dataset_chicken/head/avian_influenza/ai_head_44.jpg", "question": "How does this swollen eye differ from Newcastle Disease symptoms?", "answer": "This image shows a pronounced swollen eye with pale tissue. Newcastle Disease may also cause swelling, but it often includes neurological signs such as twisted neck or green diarrhea. For a more precise distinction, consult the reference guide."}
{"img_path": "dataset_chicken/head/avian_influenza/ai_head_44.jpg", "question": "Could this be Chronic Respiratory Disease instead of Avian Influenza?", "answer": "Chronic Respiratory Disease typically produces mild swelling with watery or foamy discharge.
